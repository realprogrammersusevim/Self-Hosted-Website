<h1>My new Self-Hosted Web Page</h1>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>
This is a simple web page that I'm serving up from my Raspberry Pi that I have in my room. I downloaded Apache and am using that as my framework.
</p>
<h2>Why is it so boring?</h2>
<p>
If this page is still up then I am currently working on learning more HTML so I can make this page more interesting or I've completely forgotten about it. If I've forgotten please come remind me.
</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>
Here's a comic that I really like. <a href="https://xkcd.com">xkcd.com</a> You can read that while you wait and pray for something interesting to be coded on this website.

This comic is pretty funny.

<!-- I'm not sure why you're reading through my code, but keep it up. Reading through the code on webpages was one of the things that first made me curious about coding. It was fascinating seeing what others had written and I wanted to be able to do that myself. Never stop being curious. Always keep exploring and learning, because you never know where it may lead you. -->
