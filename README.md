# Self-Hosted-Website
This is my little website. I have a Raspberry Pi with Apache installed to serve up webpages over the internet. It's pretty simple now, but I hope to learn more HTML, CSS, PHP, and Javascript so I can code a real website. I'm not sure what I'm going to put on it yet, so for now it's just a testing ground to try out new pieces of code and see what happens.
